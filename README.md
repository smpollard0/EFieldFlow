# EFieldFlow
This project is my capstone project for Chico State's Computer Science bachelor's degree. I plan to combine my interest in both Physics and Computer Science by creating a desktop application that will allow the user to graphically create an electric charge configuration. The program will then calculate the strength of the electric field at a point in space as well as show the vector field lines for how the electric field behaves in space. The purpose of the application to be some form of teaching/educational aid for students in introductory electricity and magnetism courses to better understand the behaviour of electric fields.
